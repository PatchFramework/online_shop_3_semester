# Online Shop 3. Semester
Hi, I'm Dominic, a student at DHBW Mannheim university in Germany. 
My study course is Business Information Systems with a focus on Data Science.
This project is part of the Web-Programming course in my 3rd semester. 

## Documentation
Requirements, models and concepts for this project can be found in [Web_Portfoliopruefung_zensiert.pdf](./Web_Portfoliopruefung_zensiert.pdf). (NOTE: This file is in german)

## Live Demo
I've hosted the website [here](https://patchframework.github.io/online_shop_3_semester). 

Note that the website is not optimized for mobile devices and might therefore yield a bad user experience on mobile.
The [Live Demo](https://patchframework.github.io/online_shop_3_semester) is hosted via github pages.


## Focus of this Project
This Project is written with the [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org) Library. For this project the following React Library features were required:

- BrowserRouter
- Stateful Components
- class- & functional-based Components
- React Hooks (useState, useLocation, etc)
- Props to exchange data between Components

        This 404 page is intended for a github pages SPA.
        When hosting on Github pages the url is composeed like this: https://{username}.github.io/{repo_name}

        Github pages searches for eny given url path in its dir for a corresponding html file.
        E.g. Navigating to "https://patchframework.github.io/online_shop_3_semester/shop" will trigger 
        github pages to search for a shop.html in its directory. 
        With a single page application that is a big problem, because it only has one html file, the index.html, 
        that can only be accessed at "https://{username}.github.io/{repo_name}". That means if a user hard refreshes
        the website or tries to access a subdirectory like "/cart" directly they will get a 404 error from github pages.

        Good for us, that github pages uses a 404.html if we provide it. This file will use the path that the user entered,
        save that path and redirect the user to the entry path to the SPA, where the path will be applied to the SPA.

        //Save the path and slice first "/" away
        const path = window.location.pathname.slice(1); 
        // Save the path, so it can be used later
        sessionStorage.setItem('path', path);

        // Save the entry path to access the SPA
        const entryPath = path.split('/')[0];
        
        /* redirect to the SPA entry path, where the path
        will be applied from sessionStorage */
        window.location.replace(`/${entryPath}`);
